# Link Keeper â€” MVP

> A simple, responsive React app for saving, editing, searching and organising your favourite links using **localStorage** as the persistence layer.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project overview

**Link Keeper** is a minimal viable product (MVP) that lets users save bookmarks (links) with a title, URL, description and optional tags.  
The app demonstrates core front-end concepts taught in Lesson 2: arrays & array methods, objects, React components, state & props, hooks (useState, useEffect), JSON methods and browser `localStorage` for persistence.

The goal is a user-friendly, accessible UI (desktop and mobile) built with plain CSS and media queries (no third-party CSS frameworks).  
This project is intended as a proof-of-concept: localStorage is used so the app can be accessed across sessions on the same browser; a real-world extension would replace localStorage with a server-side database.

## ðŸš€ Getting started â€” installation commands

Below are the commands you can run to create the project, install dependencies and run it locally.  
Choose the template (JavaScript or TypeScript) you prefer.

### Create the project (Vite)

**TypeScript template (recommended):**

```bash
# create a new Vite + React + TypeScript project
npm create vite@latest 
- chose a name for my file
- cd file name
- npm install 
- npm run dev

### Key implementation notes
* State & data model: store bookmarks as an array of objects. Example object:
``` js
{
  title: "MDN Web Docs",
  url: "https://developer.mozilla.org/",
  description: "Resources for web developers",
  tags: ["docs", "web", "reference"]
}

### ðŸ§© Evaluation mapping

- User-friendliness & design: simple, clear layout with responsive breakpoints.

- Interactivity: hover states, cursor changes, subtle transitions.
